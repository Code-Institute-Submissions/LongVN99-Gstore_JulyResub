# Project Requirements
Build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. Set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.

Required Technologies : 
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django + Django
* Relational database (MySQL or Postgres)
* Stripe Payments - Test card details can be found [HERE](documentations/testing/stripe.png)

Optional: Include use of additional libraries and external APIs.

## Mandatory Requirements

1. Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
2. Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).
3. Data Modeling: Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models beyond the examples shown on the course
4. User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so. e.g., a user would have to register to persist their shopping cart between sessions (otherwise it would be lost).
5. User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism).
6. Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout or single payments, or donations, etc. After paying successfully, the user would then gain access to additional functionality/content on the site. Note that for this project you should use Stripe's test functionality, rather than actual live payments.
7. Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
8. Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.
9. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
10. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
11. Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
12. Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
13. Security: Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. Make sure to turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.

# UX
## Project Goals

The development of this project captures the essence of a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. The idea is to create an e-commerce site for wrist watch lovers using the Django framework with PostgreSQL database, then static file hosting with AWS, and a functional payment system using Stripe platform. 

## UX Design

The application was structured using bootstrap to maintain wide browser compatibility, consistency in design and extensibility to render responsive and modern website.

### Colors
    Main color used are shade of cyan(#17a2b8), black and white

### Setting-up Automatic Deployment from GitHub

To setup Automatic Deployment from GitHub:

-   Selected Deploy on Heroku dashboard.
-   Clicked on Connect to GitHub button.
-   Ensure GitHub profile is displayed, then add repository name (same as Heroku App), and clicked search.
-   Click connect button to find the repo.
-   Then now Enable Automatic Deployment.
-   Selected branch and clicked Deploy Branch button.
-   Once it's done, you'll see "Your App was successfully deployed!!!.
-   Click "View" to launch the new app. The deployed site is now available.

## Local Deployment

-   On the GitHub Repository, click on the `â†“ Code` button.
-   Copy the link to clone the repository using the HTTPS tab.
-   In your preferred IDE CLI, navigate to the directory you would like to clone to.
-   Type git clone followed by the URL you copied from step 3 and press enter.
-   Once cloned, all files from workspace will be visible.
-   You will need to create an `env.py` that had previously been added to the `.gitignore` file.
-   Then access the folder in your terminal window and install the application requirements using the following command:`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
-   To test type the following command into the CLI and open the 8080 port: `python3 manage.py runserver`
-   Make all migrations:
    ```
    python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate --plan
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
-   Load data using fixtures:
    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata products
    python3 manage.py loaddata categoriess
    ```
-   Create a superuser:
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ***Enter username, email and password***
    ```
